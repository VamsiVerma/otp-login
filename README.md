## OTP login UI

# Description

Here I have created a model of OTP login where after the user adds phone number, he will be moved to OTP login component where he needs to insert the OTP to successful logging in.
API calling is not done, just the UI with OTP functionalilty and Phone number functionality is done.

# Functionality:

1. # Phone Number:

   In number field will only take numbers and will throw alert error if input contains any ohter characters other than numbers and if numbers inserted is less than 10 digits.

2. # OTP UI:
   In OTP field each field will take only 1 input and as soon as a number is inserted the focus goes to the next field, and same functionality is done when user removes data from a input field the cursor will move to the next field.
